# Simple Calculator Web App

This is a basic calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The interface is user-friendly and responsive, making it easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.

Key Features:

Perform basic operations: add, subtract, multiply, and divide

Clean and intuitive UI

Responsive layout using CSS

JavaScript-powered logic for real-time calculations

Error handling for invalid inputs (like division by zero)

This project demonstrates my understanding of core web technologies and DOM manipulation in JavaScript. It's a great foundation for building more advanced functionality in the future.
